# It is possible to load your favorite ~/.bashrc with all your favorite
# aliases and settings, but you have be very careful: the ~/.bashrc must
# not source any config files from the host, however, by default it does!
# And, to use your host system, you need that default. One way to go is to
# split your ~/.bashrc into ~/.bashrc.generic and have ~/.bashrc source
# ~/.bashrc.generic), then you can uncomment the following:
#source $HOME/.bashrc.generic
