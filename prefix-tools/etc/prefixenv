# Patterns (Bash regexp) for environment variables to be preserved when

^NPROC$

# NOTE: Until SLURM on USC Discovery starts allocating
# a temp directory that has non-zero free space, instead
# of just setting TMPDIR=/tmp while /tmp is full, we
# cannot let TMPDIR be set. This is because in prefixhelpers
# set_tmpdir() does trust TMPDIR, at least to the extent
# of the parent filesystem, so if TMPDIR is set to /tmp,
# then set_tmpdir will create (and cleanup) a temp dir under
# /tmp. By not forwarding TMPDIR, here, we force set_tmpdir
# to use its own default, which is /dev/shm, which so far
# has not bee observed to go out of space.
# Re SLURM no longer allocating TMPDIR, see USC HPC ARC Ticket:
# https://uschpc.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/ARC-240
