Utilities for building CASPER and running experiments.

Job to build Gentoo Prefix on USC HPPC: `jobs/gpref.job.sh`
Job to build Gentoo Prefix on other hosts: `jobs/gpref.sh`

To build Gentoo Prefix need to pre-populate `distfiles/` directory
with some special source tarballs (even if the build host is online).

All source tarballs are on USC HPCC filesystem in
`/scratch/acolin/casper-utils/distfiles/`, so you can just copy
all of it:

	rsync -aq /scratch/acolin/casper-utils/distfiles/ casper-utils/distfiles/

For offline build hosts (e.g. worker nodes on USC HPCC), the above copy
of the whole distfiles directory is a requirement. For online hosts, it
is sufficient to copy only the special tarballs listed below (however, if you
have access to all, then might as well copy all to not waste Internet
bandwidth).

The special source taballs that must be prepopulated, even for online build hosts:

* `portage-DATE.tar.bz2`
* `gentoo-DATE.tar.bz2`

  The snapshot date is indicated in the job script.  Cannot always be fetched
  from online, because upstream hosts only about 1 month.

* `gentoo-headers{,-base}-KERNEL_VERSION.tar.gz`

  Archives for the kernel version running on the host. The archives for 3.10
  are available in `distfiles/` (see below). To make an archive for other kernel
  versions, see the comments in the ebuild.

* `tetgen` (manually fill out form to get download link)
* `ampi` (manually fill out form to get download link)
* `pyop2` (due to checksum changes in tarball autogenerated by GitHub)
