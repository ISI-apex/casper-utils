# By default mpirun adds Prefix to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which breaks loading
# of host's /bin/bash by aprun (when launching orted -- aprun executes
# the command given to it via the host's shell). The value for the prefix that
# mpirun chooses is either the prefix from the path to the mpirun binary OR the
# --prefix argument when given.
#
# So, we have to pass --prefix and point it to a non-existant path. However
# when passing --prefix, mpirun cannot be invoked by a full path, because then
# mpirun autodetects this as a conflict between --prefix and the full path
# (instead of just taking --prefix as the overriding one). So, we invoke mpirun
# via the executable name by appending Prefix to PATH.
